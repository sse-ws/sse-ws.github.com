Seattle, WA, USA - November 14, 2016

Paper submission: Jul. 1, 2016


***** MOTIVATION *****

The Workshop on Social Software Engineering (SSE) focuses on the interplay between social computing and software engineering. On one hand, social factors in software engineering activities, processes and tools are essential for improving the quality of development processes and the software produced by them. Examples include the role of situational awareness and multi-cultural factors in collaborative software development. On the other hand, social software mediates people-to-people communication, supporting human choices, actions and interactions with each other. Social software needs to accommodate a wide range of social concepts, such as trust, governance, reputation, and privacy. Being social, the software would also need to be receptive to users' choices and give them a voice in the design, operation and evolution decisions. The SSE workshop brings together academic and industrial perspectives to provide models, methods, tools and approaches to address these issues. 


***** TOPICS *****

In this workshop, we will bring together researchers and practitioners who build and study socially-oriented tools to support collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering. We will also investigate systematic engineering approaches for software that accommodates social aspects, such as norms, culture, roles and responsibilities, governance, decision rights, stakeholder goals and inter-dependencies, and the involvement of clients and end-users in shaping software at the design stages and also runtime. 
This workshop is organized around the following topics regarding social software engineering:* Leveraging social computing in the requirements engineering, design, development, testing, and maintenance stages of software development* Enriching software engineering processes and activities to accommodate social aspects among stakeholders * Analyzing the use of social networks and media to connect users and incentivize their engagement in software development at design time and runtime* Redefining the software engineering risks, rewards, and opportunities of the "social" software engineer * Using social media to teach software engineering and share knowledge between stakeholders * Researching methods, models and empirical studies on the socialness of software engineering processes* Reporting experiences from both industry and academia on developing social software* Engineering methods, tools, and frameworks for social features, such as fostering social awareness and building trust among collaborators * Exploring and employing approaches in sociology and psychology to design social software* Crowdsourcing for software engineering* Envisioning forward-looking scenarios and establishing research agendas


***** TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS *****

- Full papers (up to 7 pages) describing social software engineering challenges, needs, novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with users (who did not help design the system). Empirical evaluation papers and industrial experience reports are also welcome.- Short position papers (up to 5 pages) describing a new idea or work in progress.- Posters and demo papers (up to 2 pages) summarizing a research project, tool, or technique.


***** SUBMISSION *****

Accepted papers will be published as workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. We accept only electronic submissions from the workshop homepage via Easy-Chair. To be considered for review, a paper submission must be in the ACM SIGSOFT Proceedings format (see http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates). For accepted papers, at least one author should participate at the workshop and register for the workshop at ESEC/FSE'15 conference.
